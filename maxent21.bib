  abstract = {In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a effciency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used L k norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric L(1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric L(2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the L k norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

  abstract = {A simple Lagrangian water quality model was designed to investigate the hypothesis of sporadic silica limitations of diatom growth in the lower Elbe River in Germany. For each fluid parcel a limited reservoir of silica was specified to be consumed by diatoms. The model's simplicity notwithstanding, a set of six selected model parameters could not be fully identified from existing observations at one station. After the introduction of prior knowledge of the ranges of meaningful parameter values, calibration of the over-parameterised model manifested itself primarily in the generation of posterior parameter covariances. Estimations of the covariance matrix based on (a) second order partial derivatives of a quadratic cost function at its optimum and (b) Monte Carlo simulations exploring the whole space of parameter values gave consistent results. Diagonalisation of the covariance matrix yielded two linear parameter combinations that were most effectively controlled by data from periods with and without lack of silica, respectively. The two parameter combinations were identified as the essential inputs that govern the successful simulation of intermittently decreasing chlorophyll a concentrations in summer. A satisfactory simulation of the pronounced chlorophyll a minimum in spring, by contrast, was found to be beyond the means of the simple model.},

The joint posterior distribution of six model parameters is estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling based on a quadratic likelihood function. The estimated distribution shows to which extent model parameters are controlled by observations, highlighting issues that cannot be settled unless more information becomes available. In our example, some vagueness occurs due to problems in distinguishing between the effects of either growth limitation by lack of silica or a temperature dependent algal loss rate. Knowing such indefiniteness of the model structure is crucial when the model is to be used in support of management options.

Commonly, a less computationally demanding, perhaps local, approximation to f({$\cdot$}) is available, say \$f\_\{x\}\^\{\textbackslash ast\}\textbackslash{} \$({$\cdot$}). An algorithm is proposed to generate an MCMC that uses such an approximation to calculate acceptance probabilities at each step of a modified Metropolis\textendash Hastings algorithm. Once a proposal is accepted using the approximation, f({$\cdot$}) is calculated with full precision ensuring convergence to the desired distribution. We give sufficient conditions for the algorithm to converge to f({$\cdot$}) and give both theoretical and practical justifications for its usage. Typical applications are in inverse problems using physical data models where computing time is dominated by complex model simulation. We outline Bayesian inference and computing for inverse problems. A stylized example is given of recovering resistor values in a network from electrical measurements made at the boundary. Although this inverse problem has appeared in studies of underground reservoirs, it has primarily been chosen for pedagogical value because model simulation has precisely the same computational structure as a finite element method solution of the complete electrode model used in conductivity imaging, or "electrical impedance tomography." This example shows a dramatic decrease in CPU time, compared to a standard Metropolis\textemdash Hastings algorithm.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization has recently emerged as a popular method for the sample-efficient optimization of expensive black-box functions. However, the application to high-dimensional problems with several thousand observations remains challenging, and on difficult problems Bayesian optimization is often not competitive with other paradigms. In this paper we take the view that this is due to the implicit homogeneity of the global probabilistic models and an overemphasized exploration that results from global acquisition. This motivates the design of a local probabilistic approach for global optimization of large-scale high-dimensional problems. We propose the \$\textbackslash texttt\{TuRBO\}\$ algorithm that fits a collection of local models and performs a principled global allocation of samples across these models via an implicit bandit approach. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that \$\textbackslash texttt\{TuRBO\}\$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods from machine learning and operations research on problems spanning reinforcement learning, robotics, and the natural sciences.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Data-model integration plays a critical role in assessing and improving our capacity to predict ecosystem dynamics. Similarly, the ability to attach quantitative statements of uncertainty around model forecasts is crucial for model assessment and interpretation and for setting field research priorities. Bayesian methods provide a rigorous data assimilation framework for these applications, especially for problems with multiple data constraints. However, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques underlying most Bayesian calibration can be prohibitive for computationally demanding models and large datasets. We employ an alternative method, Bayesian model emulation of sufficient statistics, that can approximate the full joint posterior density, is more amenable to parallelization, and provides an estimate of parameter sensitivity. Analysis involved informative priors constructed from a meta-analysis of the primary literature and specification of both model and data uncertainties, and it introduced novel approaches to autocorrelation corrections on multiple data streams and emulating the sufficient statistics surface. We report the integration of this method within an ecological workflow management software, Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), and its application and validation with two process-based terrestrial ecosystem models: SIPNET and ED2. In a test against a synthetic dataset, the emulator was able to retrieve the true parameter values. A comparison of the emulator approach to standard brute-force MCMC involving multiple data constraints showed that the emulator method was able to constrain the faster and simpler SIPNET model's parameters with comparable performance to the brute-force approach but reduced computation time by more than 2 orders of magnitude. The emulator was then applied to calibration of the ED2 model, whose complexity precludes standard (brute-force) Bayesian data assimilation techniques. Both models are constrained after assimilation of the observational data with the emulator method, reducing the uncertainty around their predictions. Performance metrics showed increased agreement between model predictions and data. Our study furthers efforts toward reducing model uncertainties, showing that the emulator method makes it possible to efficiently calibrate complex models.},

Hub objects have a small distance to an exceptionally large number of data points while anti-hubs lie far from all other data points.

Previous work has already advocated the use of fractional {$\mathscr{l}$}p norms instead of the ubiquitous Euclidean norm to avoid the negative effects of distance concentration. However, which exact fractional norm to use is a largely unsolved problem. The contribution of this work is an empirical analysis of the relation of different {$\mathscr{l}$}p norms and hubness. We propose an unsupervised approach for choosing an lp norm which minimizes hubs while simultaneously maximizing nearest neighbor classification. Our approach is evaluated on seven high-dimensional data sets and compared to three approaches that re-scale distances to avoid hubness.},

  abstract = {Simulation plays a major role in the conception, the optimization and the certification of complex systems. Of particular interest here is the calibration of the parameters of computer models from high-dimensional physical observations. When the run times of these computer codes is high, this work focuses on the numerical challenges associated with the statistical inference. In particular, several adaptations of the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to the high-dimensional or functional output case are presented for the emulation of computer codes from limited data. Then, an adaptive procedure is detailed to minimize the calibration parameters uncertainty at the minimal computational cost. The proposed method is eventually applied to two applications that are based on dynamic simulators.},

Statistical calibration enables scientists to incorporate field data in this analysis. However, the practical application is hardly straightforward for data structures such as spatial-temporal fields, which are usually large or not well represented by a stationary process model. We present a computationally efficient approach to estimating the calibration parameters using a criterion that measures discrepancy between the computer model output and field data. One can then construct empirical distributions for the calibration parameters and propose new computer model trials using sequential design. The approach is relatively simple to implement using existing algorithms and is able to estimate calibration parameters for large and nonstationary data. Supplementary R code is available online.},

Since the simulations are expensive it is necessary to exploit the computational budget in the best possible manner. If for a few input parameter settings an output data set has been acquired, one could be interested in taking these data as a basis for finding an extremum and possibly an input parameter set for further computer simulations to determine it\textemdash a task which belongs to the realm of global optimization. Within the Bayesian framework we utilize Gaussian processes for the creation of a surrogate model function adjusted self-consistently via hyperparameters to represent the data. Although the probability distribution of the hyperparameters may be widely spread over phase space, we make the assumption that only the use of their expectation values is sufficient. While this shortcut facilitates a quickly accessible surrogate, it is somewhat justified by the fact that we are not interested in a full representation of the model by the surrogate but to reveal its maximum. To accomplish this the surrogate is fed to a utility function whose extremum determines the new parameter set for the next data point to obtain. Moreover, we propose to alternate between two utility functions\textemdash expected improvement and maximum variance\textemdash in order to avoid the drawbacks of each. Subsequent data points are drawn from the model function until the procedure either remains in the points found or the surrogate model does not change with the iteration. The procedure is applied to mock data in one and two dimensions in order to demonstrate proof of principle of the proposed approach.},

Notwithstanding the lack of many mechanistic details, the model is able to reproduce observed chlorophyll a variability surprisingly well, including a number of sharp valleys and ascents/descents in the observed time series. The model's success is based on the assumption of three key effects: prevailing light conditions, sporadic limitation of algal growth due to lack of silica and algae loss rates that increase above an empirically specified temperature threshold of 20\textdegree C. Trimmed-down model versions are studied to analyse the model's success in terms of these mechanisms.In each of the five years the model consistently fails, however, to properly simulate characteristic steep increases of chlorophyll a concentrations after pronounced spring minima. Curing this model deficiency by global model re-calibration was found to be impossible. However, suspension of silica consumption by algae for up to 10 days in spring is shown to serve as a successful placeholder for processes that are disregarded in the model but apparently play an important role in the distinctly marked period of model failure. For the remainder of the year the very simple model was found to be adequate.},

The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity.

DA-MCMC accelerates MCMC sampling in complex applications, while still targeting the exact distribution. We design a computationally faster, albeit approximate, DA-MCMC algorithm. We consider parameter inference in a Bayesian setting where a surrogate likelihood function is introduced in the delayed-acceptance scheme. When the evaluation of the likelihood function is computationally intensive, our scheme produces a 2-4 times speed-up, compared to standard DA-MCMC. However, the acceleration is highly problem dependent. Inference results for the standard delayed-acceptance algorithm and our approximated version are similar, indicating that our algorithm can return reliable Bayesian inference. As a computationally intensive case study, we introduce a novel stochastic differential equation model for protein folding data.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization has been successful at global optimization of expensive-to-evaluate multimodal objective functions. However, unlike most optimization methods, Bayesian optimization typically does not use derivative information. In this paper we show how Bayesian optimization can exploit derivative information to decrease the number of objective function evaluations required for good performance. In particular, we develop a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm, the derivative-enabled knowledge-gradient (dKG), for which we show one-step Bayes-optimality, asymptotic consistency, and greater one-step value of information than is possible in the derivative-free setting. Our procedure accommodates noisy and incomplete derivative information, comes in both sequential and batch forms, and can optionally reduce the computational cost of inference through automatically selected retention of a single directional derivative. We also compute the d-KG acquisition function and its gradient using a novel fast discretization-free technique. We show d-KG provides state-of-the-art performance compared to a wide range of optimization procedures with and without gradients, on benchmarks including logistic regression, deep learning, kernel learning, and k-nearest neighbors.},
